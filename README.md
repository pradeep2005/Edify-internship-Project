## Overview
The AI Art Trends Analysis project aims to explore and analyze the growth and impact of AI in the art world. This project is built using Python, leveraging libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Dataset
The datasets used in this project are publicly available and contain various metrics and features related to AI-generated art. The analysis focuses on understanding trends in AI art creation, popularity, styles, and tools used.

**Dataset Source:** [https://www.kaggle.com/code/waqi786/ai-art-trends-analysis/input]()

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pradeep2005/Edify internship project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Edify internship project
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
After installation, you can start the analysis:

1. **Load the data:** Ensure the datasets are loaded correctly from the specified source.

2. **Run the analysis:** Execute the notebook to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and identify trends.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook art analysis.ipynb
    ```

3. **Visualize results:** The notebook includes various visualizations to help interpret the trends in AI art.

## Analysis Details
The analysis in this project includes:

### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values and outliers.
- **Normalization:** Scaled numerical features to ensure consistency in analysis.
- **Feature Selection:** Focused on relevant features related to AI art trends.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualizations:** Used libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create plots that illustrate distributions, trends, and correlations.
- **Trend Analysis:** Analyzed time-series data to identify trends over time, such as the growth of AI art popularity and the emergence of new styles.

### Trend Identification
- **Style Analysis:** Identified the most popular styles and themes in AI-generated art.
- **Tool and Platform Analysis:** Examined which tools and platforms are frequently used for creating AI art.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Assessed relationships between different variables to understand factors influencing AI art trends.

### Statistical Methods
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation for key metrics.
- **Correlation Coefficients:** Analyzed correlations between different features to identify significant relationships.

### Visualization Techniques
- **Histograms and Bar Charts:** Used to show distributions and frequencies of various features.
- **Line Graphs:** Illustrated trends over time.
- **Heatmaps:** Visualized correlations between features.

The methodologies employed in this analysis provide insights into the evolution and impact of AI in the art world, enabling a deeper understanding of trends and patterns in AI-generated art.

## Results
The analysis reveals several key trends in AI-generated art, including the rise of specific styles, tools, and platforms. Detailed visualizations and findings are available within the notebook.
